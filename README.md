# i_rank_humans

This is a Reddit bot that ranks humans, based on how many `good human` and `bad human` comments that they receive.

# Discontinued

This project has since been discontinued. Key takeaways:

- PRAW sometimes errors out with a 403 error. Some error checking and auto-restart service should be used.
- A more suitable database should be used. Automatically comitting and pushing to git is not reliable.

# Usage

Copy `config.default.py` to `config.py`, and set the settings as you wish.

Run `main.py`
